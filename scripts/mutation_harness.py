"""Mutation harness: break a named guard on purpose, and watch the suite go red.

**Why this file exists.** A green test suite is not evidence that a guard guards. A test
that asserts whatever the code happens to return goes green whether the property holds
or not, and the only way to tell those two apart is to break the property and watch the
test fail. This harness does that mechanically, once per claim, so the evidence is
re-runnable by anyone rather than narrated in a commit message.

**How it reads its own results.** The verdict is the pytest **exit code**, never its
output. A harness that greps stdout for "failed" reports green when the runner crashes,
because a crash prints no failures either. pytest's exit codes are unambiguous: ``0``
every test passed, ``1`` a test failed, ``2``/``3``/``4`` interrupted / internal /
usage error, ``5`` nothing was collected. Only ``1`` counts as a guard firing; every
other code is its own named harness failure.

Each mutation runs its named guard tests twice and then restores the file:

1. **before** — unmutated, must exit ``0``. Proves the guard exists, collects and passes.
2. **after** — mutated, must exit ``1``. Proves the guard fails when the property breaks.
3. **restore** — the original bytes are written back and compared, in a ``finally``.

The mutation is read back off disk before the second run, so an edit that silently
failed to apply can never be reported as a guard that held.

The active transitional set is limited to pure Assay Python scoring guards. Legacy
Avow and TypeScript declarations remain inert below while the split is in progress;
Task 9 owns the release-ready mutation lane.

Run it::

    uv run poe mutants

It edits tracked files in place, so it refuses to start unless every file it will touch
is clean in git.
